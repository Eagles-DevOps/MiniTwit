## 1. Introduction

The project focuses on building and maintaining a mock version of Twitter called **MiniTwit** by applying various DevOps techniques such as automation, cloud deployment, scaling, maintainability, monitoring, testing, and others. The initial web application, which was outdated with the latest technologies and was not following any standard practices, was rewritten from the ground up and gradually equipped with automations and improvements so that it is able to process a high load of requests coming to the app.
