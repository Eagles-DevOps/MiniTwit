# Lessons learned


## Biggest Issues
In the initial stages of the development, whole team was working on refactoring the old code into new one. This created multiple instances of merge conflicts, different coding approaches. 

## Reflection
After while we managed to get a good communication flow and organized planning. Team members took tasks which they felt comfortable with but also wanted to gain new knowledge and improve. Code reviews were taken seriously which helped us to improve and reflect on the code before it was pushed into the main. Breaking down tasks and setting deadlines for them helped us to keep the whole project on track.
