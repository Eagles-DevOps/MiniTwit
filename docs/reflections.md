# Reflections
MSc students reflections (to check in the future):
https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aitu-devops%2Flecture_notes%20MSc%20students&type=code

### Programming language (Session 2)
choice: **GO**
considered: Java, C#

**GO**
- Lower memory consumption compared to ruby, Java etc.
- Scales well, which is important for us considering the userbase will increase over time.
- Easy to learn.
- Compiles to a single binary which makes it easy to deploy (compared to).
- Comes with an opinionated formatter (gofmt) ensuring code style consistency. This reduces discussions about styling (which does not bring value to the product).
- It is a language with high developer interest meaning that it will hopefully be ease future recruitment when the application sky-rockets in popularity.

### Software Artifacts
choice: **docker**
considered: VMs, linux Packages, LXC, go packages
- lower overhead compared to VMs
- supported on most linux distributions regardless of package managers
- containers isolate the environment from the host system
- support for using different language compared to language specific artifacts
- support micro-services in our case allow us to run api and app with docker compose
- community support

### CI/CD Pipelines Tool
choice: **GitHub Actions**
considered: Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, Bamboo

**GitHub Actions**
- already integrated into code repository of our choice (Github)
- minimal setup, compared to tools such as Jenkins
- runs on cloud without need of provisioning
- modern and easy to use UI

### Artifact registry
choice: Github Container Registry
considered: **DockerHub**
considered: GitHub Packages
- largest docker registry

**Github Container Registry**
When using DockerHub we were only able to use an individual DockerHub account unless we were willing to pay for an organization.
We chose Github Container Registry since it allowed us to publish container images directly in the the GitHub organization. It also did not require us to use PATs since we could use the GITHUB_TOKEN from the aciton itself.

### Infrastructure automation platforms
choice: **terraform**
previously used: vagrant

**Terraform**
- there is currently larger community behind terraform than vagrant
- less unexpected behavior we experienced compared to using vagrant
